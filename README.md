LibRec
======

**LibRec** (http://www.librec.net) is a Java library for recommender systems (Java version 1.7 or higher required). It implements a suit of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. It consists of three major components: **Generic Interfaces**, **Data Structures** and **Recommendation Algorithms**.

### Features

* **Cross-platform:** as a Java software, LibRec can be easily deployed and executed in any platforms, including MS Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
* **Fast execution:** LibRec runs much **faster** than other libraries, and a detailed comparison over different algorithms on various datasets is available via [here](http://www.librec.net/example.html).
* **Easy configuration:** LibRec configs recommenders using a configuration file: [librec.conf](http://www.librec.net/tutorial.html#config). 
* **Easy expansion:** LibRec provides a set of well-designed recommendation interfaces by which new algorithms can be easily implemented.
