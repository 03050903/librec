  * RegSVD: regularized SVD
  * BiasedMF: user- and item-biased matrix factorization
  * SlopeOne: weighted slope one
  * SVDPlusPlus: SVD++

* lib.rec.baseline
  * GlobalAverage
  * UserAverage
  * ItemAverage
  * RandomGuess
  * ConstantGuess
  * MostPopular
  * UserKNN
  * ItemKNN


**NOTE:** more algorithms are working in progress.
